- Provides hands-on experience in data cleaning and processing.  
- Helps in automating CSV file handling, a key skill for data analysis.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Aishwarya-KB-Gowda/sales-data-analysis
2. Navigate to the project folder:  
cd sales-data-analysis
3. Ensure `sales.csv` is present in the directory.  
4. Run the script:  
python sales_data_analysis.py
5. Check the output in `sales_summary.csv`.  

## Future Enhancements
